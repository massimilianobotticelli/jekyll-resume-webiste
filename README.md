# Personal Website 

[![GitHub Pages Status](https://github.com/massimilianobotticelli/jekyll-resume-webiste/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment/badge.svg)](https://github.com/massimilianobotticelli/jekyll-resume-webiste/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment)

This project is a fork of the [Jekyll Theme Minimal Resume](https://github.com/murraco/jekyll-theme-minimal-resume) by [murraco](https://github.com/murraco).
I've customized and enhanced it to create my personal website, and I'm open-sourcing it in case it's useful for others.

**Key changes and features:**

* Add profile picture
* New layout for expertise section
* Detailed resumee with education, working experience and publications 

Check the [live demo](https://massimilianobotticelli.github.io/jekyll-resume-webiste/) or my [personal resumee](https://massimilianobotticelli.me/).
